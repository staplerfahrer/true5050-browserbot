True5050 browserbot
===

This is a Google Chrome extension to discover both True5050.com URLs.
It does this by repeatedly opening the True5050.com link until both results are found.

This extension requires the highest privileges, because it has to read browser HTTP requests to look for http://true5050.com. BUT: it doesn't do anything nasty, the proof is in the very short source code.
